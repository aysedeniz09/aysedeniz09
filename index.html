<h2>The (International) Politics of Content Takedowns: Theory, Practice, Ethics</h2>


<p>Content takedowns have emerged as one of the central pillars in the global fight against misinformation and extremism. 
Despite their increasing ubiquity as disruptive tools in political processes, their true efficacy remains up for debate. 
We ‘know’, for example, that takedowns have a strong disruptive effect on Islamic State-supporting networks online, but we do not know whether constraining avenues for expression may ultimately accelerate offline acts of violence. 
We also know that extreme-right networks have weaponised content takedowns as evidence of victimisation and the steadfast erosion of ‘free speech’, often underpinning calls to (violent) action. There is need for caution, too, as takedowns are increasingly applied by authoritarian governments in order to stifle dissent, while in various theatres of conflict, content takedowns may contribute to erasing atrocity and resistance, ultimately disrupting the archiving of war.</p>
<br>
<p>These issues bring to mind the dangers of unintended consequences, set against a background where the moderation of online content is increasingly viewed as an essential bulwark against extremism and democratic decline. 
This interdisciplinary Special Issue seeks to tease out these dynamics to shed light on one of the most prominent practices in the contemporary communicative landscape that has profound implications for modern politics and the possibilities/limitations of online communication—but one that remains to be fully understood.</p>
<br>
<p>If you would like to contribute a paper to this Special Issue, please send an abstract of no more than 250 words to James Fitzgerald (james.fitzgerald@dcu.ie) and Ayşe Lokmanoglu (ayse.lokmanoglu@northwestern.edu) by 15 September, 2022.</p>
